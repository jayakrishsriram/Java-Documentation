# Java-Documentation
 I am trying to create a Java documentation from basics.
 In command prompt 
 1. Run `javac filename.java` a new file with the name `filename.class` which is a bytecode file
 2. Then Run `java filename` Which will call the bytecode for running.

 ## Datatypes in Java:
 There are two datatypes in java. They are:
 1. Primitive datatype - Used to get or store only one data. 
 2. Reference or Non-Primitive datatype - Used to store multiple data.
