## 1. Core Interfaces
Collection: The root interface for all collections. Defines basic operations like adding, removing, and checking elements.

List: An ordered collection allowing duplicate elements. Elements can be accessed by their index. Common implementations: ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector

Set: A collection that doesn’t allow duplicate elements and doesn’t maintain order.Common implementations: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet

Queue: A collection for holding elements before processing. Typically follows FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order. Common implementations: PriorityQueue, LinkedList (which implements both List and Queue). 

Map: A collection for key-value pairs, where each key maps to a single value. Common implementations: HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap, Hashtable.

## 2. Important Classes
ArrayList: A resizable array that allows random access to elements. Useful when frequent access operations are required.

LinkedList: A doubly-linked list that allows fast insertions and deletions but slower random access.

HashSet: A Set that uses a hash table to store elements, providing constant-time performance for operations like add, remove, and contains.

TreeSet: A Set that stores elements in a sorted tree structure, allowing retrieval of elements in sorted order.

HashMap: A Map that uses a hash table to store key-value pairs. It allows one null key and multiple null values.

TreeMap: A Map that sorts keys according to their natural ordering or by a custom comparator.

## 3. Utility Class
Collections: Contains static methods to perform common operations on collections, like sorting (Collections.sort()), searching (Collections.binarySearch()), shuffling (Collections.shuffle()), and creating thread-safe versions of collections (Collections.synchronizedList()).
## 4. Key Features

Generics: Collections can use generics to ensure type safety, preventing runtime errors due to incompatible types.

Concurrency: java.util.concurrent package includes thread-safe collection classes like ConcurrentHashMap and CopyOnWriteArrayList.

Streams: With Java 8 and later, collections can be processed with the Stream API, allowing functional-style operations (like filter, map, reduce) on collections.

## 5. Common Collection Operations

Adding Elements: add(E e), addAll(Collection<? extends E> c)

Removing Elements: remove(Object o), clear()

Checking if Empty: isEmpty()

Size of Collection: size()

Iterating through Collection: Using enhanced for loop, iterator(), or Streams

# Here is the hierarchical structure of the Java Collections Framework with key interfaces and their primary implementations:

## 1. Collection Interface (Root Interface):

### List (Ordered collection that allows duplicate elements)

ArrayList (Resizable array implementation)

LinkedList (Doubly-linked list implementation)

Vector (Resizable array, synchronized)

Stack (Last-In-First-Out or LIFO stack)

Set (Unordered collection that does not allow duplicates)

### HashSet (Uses hash table for storage, no ordering)

LinkedHashSet (Preserves insertion order using a linked list)

TreeSet (Sorted set, uses a red-black tree for ordering)

Queue (Holds elements before processing, usually FIFO)

PriorityQueue (Elements are ordered based on priority)

Deque (Double-ended queue, can be used as stack or queue)

ArrayDeque (Resizable array, allows double-ended queue operations)

LinkedList (Implements both List and Deque)

## 2. Map Interface (Stores key-value pairs, no duplicate keys)

### HashMap (Uses hash table, allows one null key and multiple null values)

LinkedHashMap (Maintains insertion order)

TreeMap (Sorted map, uses red-black tree for ordering)

Hashtable (Synchronized hash table, does not allow null keys or values)

Properties (Subclass of Hashtable, used for configuration properties)

## 3. Concurrent Collections (in java.util.concurrent package)

ConcurrentHashMap (Thread-safe version of HashMap, no blocking on reads)

CopyOnWriteArrayList (Thread-safe version of ArrayList, uses copying for writes)

CopyOnWriteArraySet (Thread-safe version of Set, also uses copying for writes)

BlockingQueue (Queue with blocking operations for producer-consumer use cases)

LinkedBlockingQueue (Linked list-based blocking queue)

ArrayBlockingQueue (Fixed-size blocking queue based on array)

PriorityBlockingQueue (Priority queue with blocking operations)

DelayQueue (Specialized blocking queue for delayed elements)

## 4. Legacy Classes (Pre-Java Collections Framework, added retroactively)

Enumeration (Legacy interface for iterating over collections)

Vector (Retrofit to List interface, synchronized)

Stack (Extends Vector, legacy LIFO stack)

Hashtable (Retrofit to Map interface, synchronized)
